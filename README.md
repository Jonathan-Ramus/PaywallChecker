# Paywall-Checker-
Paywall Checker is a google chrome extension that checks whether a link leads to a paywalled site. It compares the url to a master list found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jonathan-Ramus/PaywallChecker/main/BList.txt. 

# Motivation
As far as I know, no plugin currently exists that allows users to identify paywalled news sites before accessing them. It is very annoying to click a link to a news article, only to find out you have to pay to access it. This plugin will highlight links to news sites that are paywalled.

# Installation 
Currently, the plugin can be installed by loading the files on chrome://extensions. You will need to enable developer mode to do this.
